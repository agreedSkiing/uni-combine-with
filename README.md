# To experiment with Uni combined with

This repo contains some examples that show `Uni.combine().all()` with different java classes and record objects that either contain `boolean`, `String`, `int` or Lists of the previous three mentioned types and some more complex objects that reuse other tests classes and records through inheritance and polymorphism (i think that is the correct word).
