# To experiment with Uni combined with

This repo contains some examples that show `Uni.combine().all()` with different java classes and records that either contain `boolean`, `String`, `int` or `List` objects of the previous three mentioned types and some more complex objects that reuse other classes and records through inheritance and polymorphism (I think that is the correct word).
